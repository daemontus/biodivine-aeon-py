# Biodivine/Aeon Python Bindings

This repository contains Python bindings for the Biodivine Rust libraries and tools. Each sub-folder contains one library, with an additional readme and more detailed instructions.

If you want to quickly explore the supported features, you can have a look at these [jupyter notebooks](https://deepnote.com/project/Aeonpy-Examples-CR33GbmyS2e4tqqZCcCwjA/%2Fexample_bn.ipynb).
